This script downloads a tar of VS Code Server/CLI, then extracts it to a
location expected by tunnels made by VS Code clients.

download-vs-code.sh [options] <PLATFORM> [<ARCH>]

Example:
  download-vs-code.sh \"linux\" \"x64\" --alpine

Options

--insider
    Switches to the pre-released version of the binary chosen (server or
    CLI).

--dump-sha
    Will print the latest commit sha for VS Code (server and CLI are current
    synced and always the same).

--cli
    Switches the binary download VS Code CLI.

--alpine
    Only works when downloading VS Code Server, it will force PLATFORM=linux and
    ARCH=alpine, as the developers deviated from the standard format used for
    all others.

-h, --help
    Print this usage info.
